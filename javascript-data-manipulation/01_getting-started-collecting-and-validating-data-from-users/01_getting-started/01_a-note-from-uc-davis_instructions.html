  Welcome to this course!

 <p>
  We are delighted to be a part of your continuing education. This course will provide you with a variety of tools and learning opportunities, to include video lectures, readings, assessments, peer reviews, and an opportunity to contribute to the Coursera learning community in the discussion forums.
 </p>
 <p>
  In each of the lesson sections, you’ll find learning objectives, lecture videos, readings, activities, and an opportunity to test your knowledge in quiz format. In some of the module sections you’ll also work on assignments and grade the work of your peers. A peer-review assignment, is one where you and your fellow learners have an opportunity to review and grade each other’s work. We’ll dive more into peer reviews later on in this course.

   reset your deadlines
  </strong>
  with no penalties. More information on resetting deadlines can be found here:
